Hanging out with friends and bored, trying to decide a movie

Say I am hanging out with friends, trying to decide on a movie to watch. We look through Netflix but cannot find a specific movie that piques all of our interests. I’ve used the movie recommendation app before and it scans my twitter and gave me good results for a Comedy but I can’t think of the names of all of them. By logging into the app I can look up past results I’ve gotten by selecting the old option after selecting a genre. Now I have my most recent search of movies and can share them with my friends.
